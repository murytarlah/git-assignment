### Talk about variables and the difference between var, let, and const

-   [x] var
    -   var is a keyword used to declare a variable. It is used to declare a variable globally or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.
-   [x] let
    -   let is a keyword used to declare a variable. It is used to declare a variable locally to a block scope.
-   [x] const
    -   const is a keyword used to declare a variable. It is used to declare a variable locally to a block scope. The variable declared with const cannot be reassigned.

### Talk about data Types in javascript

-   Number: Represents numeric values, both integers and floating - point numbers.

    ```javascript
    let age = 25;
    let temperature = 98.6;
    ```

-   String: Represents text and is enclosed in single or double quotes.

    ```javascript
    let name = "Alice";
    ```

-   Boolean: Represents a binary value of either `true` or`false`.

    ```javascript
    let isStudent = true;
    ```

-   Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

    ```javascript
    let emptyValue = null;
    ```

-   Undefined: Represents an uninitialized variable or missing value.

    ```javascript
    let notDefined;
    ```

-   Symbol (ES6): Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.

    ```javascript
    const uniqueKey = Symbol("description");
    ```
